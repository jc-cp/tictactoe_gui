<h1 align="center"> Tic Tac Toe</h1>
Python implementation of this popular and easy game with a GUI.

Usually, in this game, a player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, the usual games use “X” and “O”. If the first player chooses “X”, then the second player must play with “O” and vice versa. A player marks one of the 3×3 squares with his symbol (perhaps “X” or “O”) and he aims to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions:

  - Create a straight line before your opponent to win the game.
  - Prevent his opponent from creating a straight line first.

If no one can logically create a straight line with its symbol, the game ends in a tie. So there are only three possible outcomes: one player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins, or there is a tie.
